Fully connected neural network implementation that utilizes Momentum and RPMSProp to perform gradient descent.


TODO:

1. Add functionality to save trained network and to free allocated heap memory.
2. Add functionality to load a trained network and re-train it.
3. Add functionality to split data into validation-train-test data.
4. Add functionality to pause trainig automatically depending on e.g., derivative magnitude, validation data performance and more.
